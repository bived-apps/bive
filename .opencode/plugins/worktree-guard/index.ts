// Bive's guard, the OpenCode 2 plugin: before any tool runs, check.ts decides (README › Files, AGENTS.md › Rules).
// `ctx.location.directory` is this session's directory. The session is a delegate's when BIVE_ROLE=delegate, when
// that directory is `.worktrees/issue-<n>`, when it holds `.bive/state/role` saying `delegate` (the coordinator
// writes it at start), or, per call, when the tool event's `agent` is `delegate` (0.2 part 2: an API-created session
// has no variable and may sit in any worktree). A supervisor's session (BIVE_ROLE=supervisor, the role file, or the
// agent `supervisor`) also refuses `git commit` and `git push`, over ssh too (#197). A child session (subagent) runs in its parent's instance and environment: its writes and shell
// `workdir` in `.worktrees/issue-<n>/` are checked as that delegate's, but a delegate session elsewhere, with neither
// the variable nor the role file, fails open (treated as the coordinator). A refusal is a thrown error, which the
// model reads and must work around inside its worktree. `@opencode/plugin` is supplied by OpenCode itself.
