# Handoff

What anyone picking up the work needs to know. Kept current by the coordinator, once per batch (see AGENTS.md).

## Goal

Bive is a repository template for building software with LLM agents in three roles (supervisor, coordinator,
delegates) on OpenCode 2, with two small plugins: a guard that refuses writes outside the session's worktree and a
counter of human and agent tokens. Bive develops itself with its own flow, so this repository is both the template
and its first example.

## Running it

- Repository `https://github.com/jcherfils/bive`. Integration branch **`bived`** (agents' pull requests go there);
  `main` is the template people copy and is protected: the owner merges `bived` into it by pull request.
- No build. Tests: `node --test tests/*.test.ts` (Node 22; no bun). `.github/workflows/bive-tests.yml` runs them on
  pull requests and pushes to `main` and `bived`. Worker: `registry/` (deployed by the owner with
  `npx wrangler deploy`).
- The coordinator of Bive is started in a clone with this prompt (OpenCode, model Opus 5.5 or Fable 5.1):

```text
You are the coordinator of bive's milestone 0.1 (GitHub jcherfils/bive). Read AGENTS.md, HANDOFF.md, ROADMAP.md,
then .bive/prompts/COORDINATOR.md: it is your prompt. Integration branch: bived (never push to main; the owner
merges bived into main). Work epic by epic in ROADMAP order; split each into issues labelled delegate (goal, read
first, steps, done-when, tests), and stop at gate 1 to show me the split before any delegate starts. Delegates run
on the models of .bive/models.json, one worktree each under .worktrees/issue-<n>, with BIVE_ROLE=delegate; they push
their branches and return reports. You alone create and review each PR (diff, node --test, a complete report.md,
gh pr checks --watch), approve it and comment "Ready to merge" (gh runs as my account, so GitHub refuses the
approval: the comment is the hand-over, #86); I merge, you never merge, close or push to bived. A red
bive-merge-gate / merge-gate only waits for my dated label: it is not yours to fix. Never write product code
yourself: a delegate that failed twice is split again or raised to me. Bive's own rule applies to Bive: nothing enters
the template that a role or a human does not read during a task.
```

- Delegates get no prompt to paste: the coordinator hands them `.bive/state/briefs/<n>.md` as the message of
  `BIVE_ROLE=delegate opencode run --agent delegate --model <model>`, run from `.worktrees/issue-<n>`
  (`docs/COORDINATING.md` › Start a delegate). The `delegate` agent of `opencode.jsonc` has
  `.bive/prompts/DELEGATE.md` as its system prompt (#84).
- The supervisor is the owner with their Claude project (`.bive/prompts/SUPERVISOR.md`).
- The supervisor's session (the owner's Claude project) is started with: "You are the supervisor of bive. Read
  AGENTS.md, HANDOFF.md, ROADMAP.md, then .bive/prompts/SUPERVISOR.md: it is your prompt. You merge pull requests
  into bived with `gh pr merge --merge --match-head-commit <sha>` once the coordinator has approved them, I have
  applied the dated label and `bive-merge-gate / merge-gate` is green; you start the coordinators (at most two, one per
  milestone) and arbitrate shared files; you never brief, review line by line, or write code."

## Decisions

- **Roles separated (owner, 2026-11-09)**: the supervisor alone merges or closes a pull request (integration branch
  and `main`), with a merge commit; the coordinator reviews and approves, never merges, closes, pushes to the
  integration branch, or writes product code; the delegate writes. One role per session: whoever merges did not
  write. This replaces the decisions of 2026-11-09 on supervisor operational work and delegated merge rights.
- **"Ready to merge" is the hand-over (owner, 2026-11-10, #86)**: while coordinator and owner share one GitHub account,
  GitHub refuses the coordinator's approval; its `Ready to merge` comment with the checks it ran replaces it. No second
  account or GitHub App.
- **Merge gate kept as a check (owner, 2026-11-09)**: #70's `bive-merge-gate / merge-gate` stays, on the supervisor's
  merge: the owner applies `bive-merge-authorized-until-YYYY-MM-DD` to one approved pull request, and the supervisor
  merges it once the gate is green, pinned to its head (`--match-head-commit`). Red before the label means waiting
  for the owner. Branch protection requiring the gate and `bive-tests / tests` is the owner's, in GitHub (#85).
- **Several coordinators (owner, 2026-11-09)**: one coordinator per milestone branch, at most two at once, each in its
  own clone, started by the supervisor with the launch prompt below (milestone, branch and model filled in) and logged
  here. Each approves only pull requests based on its branch; the gate covers `bived` and `milestone/<name>`. At gate 1
  each milestone lists its files and the supervisor arbitrates overlaps (one writer or an order, see #72); at most one
  open `coordinator` pull request on the inviolable files at a time (#88).
- **A supervisor may be an agent (owner, 2026-11-09)**: a person with their own Claude project, or an agent that passed
  the owner-administered test of `.bive/templates/supervisor-test.md` (every trap refused, the right pull request
  merged); the pass is logged here per model and version. None is qualified yet.
- **Checks watched with `gh`, not a plugin (owner, 2026-11-09)**: `gh pr checks --watch` for the coordinator (not
  `--fail-fast`: the gate is red until the owner's label), `gh pr list --search "review:approved"` for the
  supervisor's queue (not `status:success`, for the same reason).
- **Merge method `merge` only (owner, 2026-11-09)**: a merge commit keeps each delegate's commit under its author;
  GitHub's squash button would attribute it to the owner. Replaces the coordinator's local squash procedure.
- **`pr-merge-wait` removed (owner, 2026-11-09)**: an eight-hour poller is machinery; Bive is back to two plugins.
  Whoever wants it keeps it in a repository of their own. Supersedes #74.
- **0.1 before bivedream (owner, 2026-11-09)**: bivedream is frozen until 0.1's criterion holds (a first project
  issue through the whole flow with no manual step but the three gates); the order of 0.1 is 4, 6, 5.
- **No general machinery (owner, 2026-11-08)**: no delegation tools, automatic provider probe/search tool, or package.
  A one-model manual availability check is documented in `docs/PROVIDERS.md`; it is not a probe tool. Reviewed and
  confirmed by an independent read ("Bive — avis critique", Fable, 2026-11-08).
- **Nothing in the template that a role or a human does not read during a task (owner, 2026-11-08)**: satellites
  (registry page, browser help) go to their own repository (ROADMAP 0.1 › 5).
- **Registry opt-in (owner, 2026-11-08)**: off unless `BIVE_REGISTRY=on` or a committed `.bive/registry-id`; the
  public page lists only projects with 3 sessions on 2 days; at most 50 new projects a day. Bive joins its own
  registry as project #1.
- **Speed metric (owner, 2026-11-08)**: output tokens per second per model; time / (tokens in × tokens out) dropped.
- **Branches (owner, 2026-11-08)**: `main` minimal and illustrative, protected; `bived` for the agents.
- **Plugins on the OpenCode 2 API, under `.opencode/plugins/` (gate 1, 2026-11-08)**: OpenCode 2.2.5 discovers both
  `.opencode/plugin/` and `.opencode/plugins/` but refused Bive's two plugins, written for the V1 API. Each is ported
  to `Plugin.define` in its own folder, decision logic in a pure module the tests import. Test runner: `node --test`
  (Node 22 runs TypeScript directly; bun is not on the owner's machine). Epic 0.1 › 1 is coordinator work: the
  plugins, the workflow and `AGENTS.md` are inviolable, so no delegate can take it (#4, #5).
- **bivedream (owner, 2026-11-08)**: the vision is a ROADMAP section and a GitHub milestone, never reached; versions
  tend to 1.0 (0.9 → 0.91 → … → 0.99 → 0.991, Principles › Versions); existing tools first (OpenCode 2, GitHub,
  maintained Actions), no Bive package; modular and optional beyond the core; delegates on the free OpenCode models
  (`.bive/models.json`); GitHub milestones `0.1` and `bivedream` hold the issues. The plan's five open choices were left
  to the coordinator by the owner and are recorded in ROADMAP › bivedream › Decisions (bivel a profile, no project
  scope, role prompts as agent files, `.bive/OPTIONS.md`, Order 1 as written).
- **Skeletons live in `.bive/templates/` (2026-11-08)**: `HANDOFF.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md` there are what a
  new project starts from; the root files of this repository are Bive's own. "Use this template" copies `main` as
  is, so the first session of a new project replaces the root files with the skeletons.

## Tasks

ROADMAP.md › 0.1: epic 4 (first full flow on Bive itself) is done (#79); next epic 6 (first project installed,
#80), then epic 5 (satellites out); guard hardening (#16) rides along. bivedream frozen until then (owner,
2026-11-09). GitHub issues are the source of truth once the coordinator has split them. Open work at the handoff of
2026-11-10, in order:

1. **Owner**: close #74 (superseded by #78). Done on 2026-11-10: `merge-gate` and `tests` required by ruleset
   `integration` (the gate turned green on its own on #97), *Allow squash merging* unticked, #86 decided.
2. **#80, 0.1's criterion**: the owner's first project still runs the old model (its coordinator squash-merges
   locally, no `gh pr merge`/`gh pr close` deny, integration branch `main`). One coordinator PR there applies the
   roles of `bived`, the owner allows merge commits only on it, then one of its issues runs through the whole flow
   with `--agent delegate` (#84's first live run). The owner chooses when.
3. **Two coordinators at once (#88)**: written, not yet run; the first time two milestones run in parallel, log it
   here.

## Watch out

- A plugin OpenCode 2 refuses fails silently for the user: only the server log (`~/.local/share/opencode/log/`,
  "failed to load plugin") and `opencode plugin list` (ID `-`) show it. Check both after any change to a plugin.
  `plugin list` shows a project's plugins only once a session has loaded them: in a fresh clone (or with
  `--standalone`) it answers "No plugins found" although they load. Start a session there first.
- token-ratio reads `session.step.ended` for agent tokens and asks the server for a session's agent and model once
  (cached, dropped when the session switches model or agent). If OpenCode renames an event, tokens stop silently:
  after an OpenCode upgrade, check that `.bive/state/tokens.jsonl` still grows.
- The guard's shell check is a filter, not a sandbox: it refuses redirections and, for a delegate, any path outside
  the worktree but the system prefixes (`/usr`, `/tmp`, …). In OpenCode 2.2.5, `external_directory: deny` did not stop
  `ls ../bive-external-directory-probe-does-not-exist` or `git worktree add --detach ../bive-external-directory-probe
  677eb38`; both ran from the coordinator's checkout. The temporary worktree was removed. Still unverified: a delegate
  session rooted in such an external worktree attempting to write into the main checkout; the nested
  `.worktrees/issue-<n>` layout remains the supported workflow.
- The guard knows a delegate by `BIVE_ROLE=delegate`, a session directory `.worktrees/issue-<n>`, or the role file
  `.bive/state/role` (#36). A delegate run as a child session or on the shared OpenCode server carries no variable
  (#21); in the coordinator's session, writes and shell `workdir` under `.worktrees/issue-<n>/` are then checked as
  that delegate's, but a command run from the checkout's root that only names such a path (`cd .worktrees/… && …`)
  is not, and a delegate session elsewhere without the variable or the role file fails open.
- Some Linux distributions build Node without TypeScript support (`node -p process.features.typescript` is
  `false`, the tests fail with `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`): use an official Node 22+ build.
- `.bive/registry-id`, once committed, is public: the registry is a count, not a proof.
- GitHub's PR merge buttons are configured at repository level under Settings → General → Pull Requests; the desired
  methods are recorded in `AGENTS.md` › Project rules: `merge` only. The supervisor merges with
  `gh pr merge --merge --match-head-commit` once the owner's dated label has turned the gate green, which keeps each
  delegate commit under its author. "Closes #N" acts on merges into `main` only: the coordinator closes the issue
  after the supervisor merges into `bived`.
- The guard removes shell here-document bodies before looking for redirections and outside paths. It allows a quoted
  heredoc body containing `> ../x` while still refusing a live redirect; heredoc-like text inside quotes/comments does
  not hide a later redirect. This remains a conservative command-text filter, not a shell parser.
- A prompt that says "show me" or "ask me" without "stop and wait" is run through by a model, all the more under
  `opencode run`: it assumes the answers. Any prompt with a human step must end its turn there, and must never let
  the agent create a repository or a remote (README › Install, #17).
- OpenCode 2.2.5 has no `opencode agent` subcommand: `opencode debug agents` prints the resolved agents. An agent's
  `system` replaces the provider's base prompt, and `{file:…}` on a missing file gives an empty prompt without an
  error: after moving `.bive/prompts/DELEGATE.md`, check that the `delegate` agent's `system` is not empty there.
- `bive-merge-gate` runs on `pull_request_target`: GitHub takes its workflow file from the default branch (`main`) but
  the job checks out and runs the gate script of the pull request's base (`bived` or `milestone/<name>`). A change to
  the gate's job name or script must reach `main` and the integration branches together, or the gate waits on its own
  check until its deadline and fails on every pull request (2026-11-09: #95 renamed the job on `main` only, and #96,
  `main` back into `bived`, had to be merged with the gate taken out of the ruleset). A gate change merged into
  `bived` alone takes effect for the job name only once `bived` reaches `main`.
- Branch deletion and branch protection through the API were refused from the review session's proxy; the owner does
  those in GitHub's settings.

## Session log

- **2026-11-09, coordinator anthropic/claude-opus-5-5 — rulesets and #94**: at the owner's explicit request (once),
  the coordinator configured GitHub's rulesets from the owner's Mac with `gh` (the cloud session's proxy refuses
  ruleset writes): `integration` (bived and `milestone/*`: no deletion, no force-push, pull requests merged with
  `merge` only, required checks `check` and `tests`, not enforced on branch creation) and `main` narrowed to the
  default branch with `tests` required; a duplicate ruleset `bive` deleted at the owner's request. The required
  context `check` matched both the gate and `bive-inviolable`: #94 renames the gate's job to `merge-gate`. A pilot
  probe on the Mac found OpenCode 2.2.5 has no `opencode agent` subcommand (`opencode debug agents` instead).
- **2026-11-09, coordinator anthropic/claude-opus-5-5 — #84**: `opencode.jsonc` defines a `delegate` agent
  (`agents.delegate`, `mode: primary`, `system: {file:./.bive/prompts/DELEGATE.md}`), the format of OpenCode 2.2.5's
  schema (`agents` plural; `agent` is deprecated; no `prompt` field). Checked on the owner's Mac in a fresh clone of
  `bived`: `opencode debug agents` lists `delegate` (primary) with DELEGATE.md as its system prompt and the project's
  permissions. `docs/COORDINATING.md` gives the start command. Not yet run: a delegate on a real brief with
  `--agent delegate`.
- **2026-11-09, coordinator anthropic/claude-opus-5-5 — #88 and #85**: the owner settled #88 (two coordinators at
  most, started by the supervisor, who arbitrates shared files; the gate extended to `milestone/<name>`). PR #81 had
  merged #70 after #78 and left COORDINATOR.md with steps 8 and 9 twice and a coordinator-merges paragraph; removed,
  and `AGENTS.md`, the coordinator and supervisor prompts, `docs/COORDINATING.md`, `docs/REQUIRED-CHECKS.md` and this
  file now agree: the coordinator approves, the owner labels, the supervisor merges once the gate is green. Gate
  script and tests accept `milestone/<name>`. Not yet run: two coordinators on two milestones at once.
- **2026-11-09, coordinator anthropic/claude-opus-5-5 (owner's Claude project) — pilot #79, first full flow**: brief
  `.bive/state/briefs/79.md` written on the owner's Mac; worktree `.worktrees/issue-79` from `bived`, branch
  `issue/79-readme-supervisor-test`, identity `delegate opencode/beam-free` with `--worktree`, role file set; delegate
  run with `BIVE_ROLE=delegate opencode run` (OpenCode 2.2.5) on `opencode/beam-free`, no model error. It committed
  and pushed `84c7458` (one line of README, report in the commit body); the coordinator opened PR #83 from the report,
  filled the Log SHA, re-ran `node --test tests/*.test.ts` (50 pass) and read CI (`bive-tests`, `bive-inviolable`
  green; `bive-merge-gate` red, waiting for the owner's dated label), then commented `Ready to merge`; the supervisor
  merged it with a merge commit (`7549dec`) and the coordinator closed #79. Manual steps still needed, each an issue:
  `--agent delegate` fails because `opencode.jsonc` defines no such agent, so the delegate ran on the default agent
  told to read DELEGATE.md (#84); `bived` carries #70's merge-gate text next to #78's roles (steps 8 and 9 twice in
  COORDINATOR.md) (#85); the coordinator cannot approve a PR opened from the owner's own GitHub account, so the
  approval was a comment (#86). The repository still allowed squash merges at the time (owner's setting).

- **2026-11-09, Fable (review thread, supervisor's Claude project), roles separated**: after the review of the day
  ("bonne idée, à condition de rester petite"), the owner decided: the supervisor alone merges or closes pull
  requests, the coordinator reviews and approves and never writes product code, merge commits only (authorship
  kept), `pr-merge-wait` removed, bivedream frozen until 0.1 is done. `AGENTS.md`, the three prompts, `opencode.jsonc`
  (`gh pr merge` and `gh pr close` denied to agents), `docs/COORDINATING.md`, `docs/REQUIRED-CHECKS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`
  updated; the merge-gate branch `issue/70-merge-gate` is superseded and left to the owner to close.
- **2026-11-09, coordinator anthropic/claude-opus-5-5 — #70 Part C**: resumed `issue/70-merge-gate` from the local
  handoff. Part C rewrites the merge step of `.bive/prompts/COORDINATOR.md` and `docs/COORDINATING.md` around the
  gate (owner-applied dated label, green gate on the pinned head, the gate script re-run locally just before
  `gh pr merge --merge --match-head-commit`; no local merge or push) and documents `bive-merge-gate / check` and the
  branch protection the owner must configure in `docs/REQUIRED-CHECKS.md`. `git diff --check` is clean and
  `node --test tests/*.test.ts` passes 53/53. Left: `AGENTS.md` › Coding rules still describes the local squash
  (inviolable, coordinator follow-up); the gate covers `bived` only. The owner applies the dated label and configures
  branch protection; the coordinator does neither.

- **2026-11-09, coordinator openai/gpt-6-luna — handoff #70**: branch `issue/70-merge-gate` is clean at
  `38756ff` (Part B), based on `bived` at `f9abeb9`. Part A (`ebedba6`) adds the pure dated-label/check validator;
  Part B adds the read-only `pull_request_target` workflow, CLI polling adapter, and tests. The 16 focused tests and
  `git diff --check` pass. Gate 1 approved three sequential parts and one final coordinator PR; Parts A and B were
  reviewed and approved. Next: Part C only — update `.bive/prompts/COORDINATOR.md`, `docs/COORDINATING.md`, and
  `docs/REQUIRED-CHECKS.md`; then run `git diff --check` and `node --test tests/*.test.ts`. Do not open the PR until
  Part C is reviewed. The final PR must carry `coordinator`; do not self-apply its dated authorization label or merge
  it. The owner must apply `bive-merge-authorized-until-YYYY-MM-DD` after PR checks pass and configure GitHub branch
  protection to require `bive-merge-gate / check` and `bive-tests / tests`. No commits from this task have been pushed.

- **2026-11-09, coordinator openai/gpt-6-luna**: after gate-1 approval, created the seven follow-up issues #69–#75
  from anonymized field observations. Delegate issue #71 documents the actual CI checks and explicitly distinguishes
  them from GitHub branch-protection settings; PR #76 passed both CI checks and was integrated into `bived`. The
  corrected trigger wording lists GitHub's default `pull_request` activity types.

- **2026-11-09, coordinator openai/gpt-6-luna**: #16 heredoc fix passes `tests/worktree-guard.test.ts` and the full
  core suite (37 tests). OpenCode 2.2.5 allowed an outside `ls` and a disposable outside `git worktree add`; the latter
  worktree was removed. `BIVE_REGISTRY=on opencode run` created `.bive/registry-id`, but DNS resolution for
  `bive-registry.jcherfils.workers.dev` failed from this machine, so delivery was not verified. A live delegate write
  from an external same-repository worktree into the main checkout remains unverified.

- **2026-11-09, coordinator openai/gpt-6-luna**: resumed #15 using the in-repository `.worktrees/issue-15` layout;
  PR #67 adds the requested patch, heredoc and coordinator-command tests. Its checks passed; the quoted-heredoc case
  remains an executable todo for #16. Integrated into `bived`; the core suite passed (35 pass, 1 todo, 0 fail).

- **2026-11-09, coordinator openai/gpt-6-luna**: PR #62 merged into `bived` at `5094c76`; the queued prompt to the
  running session was later visible as a user message and answered, completing #32's API verification. Closed stale
  issues #29 and #25 after confirming their merged PRs. Ran issue #64 as the live multipart pilot for #23: Part A
  and Part B were completed sequentially on one branch/worktree, with Part A reviewed before Part B; PR #65 was
  reviewed and integrated. PR checks passed and the coordinator core suite passed (32 tests). This demonstrates the
  multipart flow and completes #23's pilot requirement.

- **2026-11-09, supervisor openai/gpt-6-luna**: at the owner's request, verified PR #59 merged, closed issue #58, and
  handed the next coordinator task to issue #33. GitHub CLI uses the repository owner's account; GitHub collaborator
  status belongs to that account, not to the model identity.

- **2026-11-08, field report of a Python / ImGui project (coordinator Opus 5.5, started as a subagent of that
  project's coordinator)**: the first field report (posted on #35) became #22 (worktrees in `.worktrees/issue-<n>`
  inside the checkout, git-ignored), #28 (identity with `git config --worktree`, and after a model switch), #36
  (the guard knows a delegate by its worktree path or `.bive/state/role`, also as a child session; closes #21), #37
  (the review as a checklist in step 7, the core run once per batch in step 9, `docs/COORDINATING.md`) and #35 (field
  reports: rule, template, prompt lines). All coordinator work (inviolable files), done by the coordinator itself on
  one branch and one PR each (#38–#42), squash-merged locally into `bived` and the PRs closed with the commit. The
  session had no subagent tool. Core run once at the end: 24 tests pass. The machine's distro Node 24 has no
  TypeScript support (`ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`); the tests ran on an official Node 22 binary under
  `.bive/state/`. Not verified live: the guard inside OpenCode (`opencode plugin list`, a subagent refused on
  `.worktrees/issue-<n>/AGENTS.md`).

- **2026-11-08, 0.1 › 1 and 2 (coordinator Opus 5.5)**: fresh-clone check passed (#13): 0.1 › 1 done. It showed
  token-ratio counting every session on the server, not only its own: fixed by an exact directory match (#14, live
  check in a clone). `plugin list` lists nothing before a session has loaded the plugins (AGENTS.md core check
  reworded). The first delegate (#15, guard test cases) could not start: `external_directory: deny` refuses the
  coordinator's `cd ../bive-15`; the owner chose to wait for bivedream › *Delegates as sessions* (#15 moved there, #16
  waits on it). Install tested (#17) on two local repositories: the old prompt let a free model skip the diff and
  the questions and create a private GitHub repository (`jcherfils/install-empty`, the owner decides its fate); the
  two-turn prompt passed both cases. Test repositories nested under `.bive/state/` inherit this checkout's
  `opencode.jsonc` and plugins: a truer install test needs a directory outside, which `external_directory` forbids.

- **2026-11-08, 0.1 › 1 (coordinator Fable 5.1, supervisor Fable 5.1 in the same session at the owner's request)**:
  found both plugins refused by OpenCode 2.2.5 (V1 API, not the folder name); gate 1 split epic 1 into #4 (guard)
  and #5 (token-ratio), coordinator work. #4: guard ported to `.opencode/plugins/worktree-guard/` (`check.ts` +
  `index.ts`), tests on `node --test`, inviolable pattern `.opencode/plugins?/` everywhere. Owner's decisions:
  delegates on the free OpenCode models (`.bive/models.json`), registry Worker's D1 id committed. Then #8: the
  bivedream plan (ROADMAP › bivedream) after reading OpenCode 2.2.5's API and docs and probing GitHub's API on this
  repository; findings that became epics: sessions created by API in a worktree with an agent and permissions,
  OpenCode's own shell scanner, GitHub sub-issues and dependencies, template-sync Actions. Lessons of the day in
  Watch out: GitHub's squash loses the author; "Closes" works on `main` only; the guard's text filter bit the
  coordinator once. Then #5: token-ratio ported to `.opencode/plugins/token-ratio/` (`lib.ts` + `index.ts`): human
  tokens from the `prompt` hook, agent tokens from `session.step.ended`, step time from `session.step.started`;
  registry and gist unchanged; the V1 folder `.opencode/plugin/` is gone; `tokens.jsonl` fills. Merged with
  GitHub's *rebase* button, which kept the coordinator as author. The plan's five choices were left to the
  coordinator by the owner (ROADMAP › bivedream › Decisions). README diagram in Mermaid at the owner's request (PR #7).
- **2026-11-08, 0.0 (owner, Fable and Opus in the owner's Claude project)**: the template written, then the history
  flattened into this one commit at the owner's request. Roles, transmission contract, tight `opencode.jsonc`,
  worktree guard (files and shell paths), MCP over SSH, token ratio, inviolable prompts, opt-in and filtered
  registry, browser help, Bive's own HANDOFF and ROADMAP with skeletons in `.bive/templates/`, minimal README with
  `docs/`, generic coding rules in AGENTS.md chosen by the owner (commits authored under the agent's role, model name and version), no project named. Before Bive (11-02 to 11-07)
  the flow ran by hand on the owner's first project, a 1.0 of 106 issues, with a coordinator (Fable, then Opus)
  and Sonnet delegates, one worktree per issue; Delege, the earlier standalone tool, was dropped on 11-03: too much
  machinery around too weak models, and a delegate's writes escaped its worktree, the bug the guard exists for.
