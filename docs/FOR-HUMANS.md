# Bive for the human owner

What you do, and what you never have to do. The agents do the rest.

## Your three jobs

1. **Agree the plan** (gate 1): read `ROADMAP.md` and the split the coordinator proposes; say yes, no or other.
2. **Answer questions** the coordinator brings you, in one line each (below).
3. **Press the merge authorization** on each pull request you accept: the dated label (below). Nobody else does.

## Answering a question

The coordinator posts questions as a block (`.bive/templates/question.md`) numbered Q1, Q2... Answer one line per
question, in the session or as a comment on the issue:

- `Q2 yes` or `Q2 no`
- `Q2 other: <what you want>`
- `Q2 advisor`: get read-only advice (the advisor answers, then returns the decision to you; advice is not
  authorization)
- `Q2 coordinator`: let the coordinator decide (never accepted for merges, the label, gates, or rule changes)

A question with no answer after one day gets a public status comment on the issue and may move up or around as the
skill `bive-ask-owner` says. Everything you answer is also written on the issue, so there is a record.

## The dated merge label

Every pull request into `bived` (or a `milestone/<name>`) shows a red check, `bive-merge-gate / merge-gate`, until you
authorize it. That red means "waiting for the owner", not "broken". To authorize:

1. Read the pull request (the coordinator has approved it and tests are green).
2. Add the label `bive-merge-authorized-until-YYYY-MM-DD`, with **today's date in UTC** (on GitHub: the pull request's
   Labels box; or `gh pr edit <n> --add-label bive-merge-authorized-until-YYYY-MM-DD`; create the label first if it does
   not exist: `gh label create <that name>`).
3. The gate turns green by itself. The owner then merges, with a merge commit, never squash. By default the
   coordinator cannot merge; an explicitly scoped owner grant is required and is not enabled by default. See
   `docs/COORDINATOR-MERGES.md` (design; not implemented yet).

Rules of the label: it is valid until 23:59:59 UTC of its date; the date must be the day you apply it (a future date
is refused); the coordinator never applies it. Remove it to withdraw the authorization. A pull request that changes the
rules, the prompts, the plugins or `opencode.jsonc` carries the label `coordinator`: those are the only ones allowed to
change them, and still need yours. Details: `docs/REQUIRED-CHECKS.md`.

## The public registry (optional)

At install you are asked once whether the project reports **anonymously** to the public registry
(<https://bived-apps.github.io/registry/>). It is off unless you say yes.

- **Yes**: the agents write a random id into `.bive/registry-id` and commit it. From then on every session reports a
  random id, token counts per model, violation counts and the code size rounded to two digits. No name, path, text or
  date.
- **No** (or no answer): nothing is created and nothing is sent.
- **Change your mind**: delete `.bive/registry-id` in a pull request; on one machine `export BIVE_REGISTRY=off` stops it
  at once.
- A project is listed on the page only after three sessions on two different days, as `#1`, `#2`... without its id.
