# The coordinator's routine, as commands

What `.bive/prompts/COORDINATOR.md` steps 5, 7 and 9 mean at the shell, for a coordinator that wants the exact
commands. `<n>` is the issue, `<slug>` a short name, `<base>` the integration branch, `<model>` the delegate's
`provider/model`.

## Authority (issue #262)

The owner alone authorizes work and merges, approves teams and the three gates, and arbitrates shared files. An advisor
answers questions about the current worktree read-only and prepares decision or handoff text; that is advice, not
authorization. No advisor text, bench pass, shared account or collaborator association counts as the owner's approval.
A bench pass is capability evidence only. By default a coordinator approves pull requests based on its branch but never
merges or closes one. An explicitly scoped owner grant may let a named coordinator execute specific sub-coordinator
pull-request merges; see *Coordinator merge exception (design, not implemented)* below. Historical supervisor
qualifications grant no authority.

## Coordinator merge exception (opt-in, off by default)

Default: a coordinator never merges or closes a pull request, and no agent approves or merges into `main`. The owner
may, by a grant in `.bive/gate.json` on the base branch, let a named parent coordinator approve and merge its direct
sub-coordinator's pull requests into `bived` or `milestone/<name>`, with `bive_coordinator_merge` as the only path.
The approval is signed with a per-grant key the owner hands over; the gate accepts it instead of the dated label. A
pull request that changes authority or enforcement files, or the coordinator's own work, is always the owner's to
merge. `coordinatorMerges` ships `false` and no grant exists. Contract, limits and status: `docs/COORDINATOR-MERGES.md`.
Not yet verified live end to end.

## Before a milestone (issue #116)

Run these three checks before gate 1, before the first delegate starts. If one fails, tell the owner and do not
start delegates.

1. **Runners online**: the runners the project's workflows use are online.
   - Self-hosted runners: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runners` (needs admin rights; without them, ask the
     owner to check the runner status in GitHub's settings).
   - Hosted runners: no check needed; GitHub provides them.
2. **Local environment version**: the runtime version of the project's local environment equals the one installed now.
   The project fills the command in `AGENTS.md` › Before committing (Bive's own: `node --version` is 22). A mismatch
   means the environment was built with another interpreter version.
3. **Fast checks green on the base**: the fast checks have been seen green once on the milestone's base, in CI, before
   the first delegate starts. A red base blocks all other merges until green.

## Session start

Fetch first, so no worktree is based on a stale local branch (field report #110, remark 2): `git fetch --prune`.

The label the owner applies to authorize a merge must exist that day (owner, 2026-11-10). Create it, never rename an
older one: renaming moves the label onto every pull request that carries it and would re-date the owner's past
authorizations. The coordinator never applies it.

```bash
label="bive-merge-authorized-until-$(date -u +%F)"
gh label list --search "$label" --json name --jq '.[].name' | grep -qx "$label" \
  || gh label create "$label" --color B60205 --description "Owner only: authorizes one merge through $(date -u +%F) UTC"
gh label list --search coordinator --json name --jq '.[].name' | grep -qx coordinator \
  || gh label create coordinator --color 5319E7 --description "Coordinator's own pull request (inviolable files); set by the coordinator"
```

The flow uses only these labels (`docs/REQUIRED-CHECKS.md` › Labels the flow uses).

## Start a coordinator: the hand-over is a GitHub comment (issue #202, owner 2026-11-12)

The guard keeps every agent's writes inside its own worktree, so a hand-over file outside it cannot be written by an
agent. The hand-over (`.bive/templates/launch.md`, filled) is therefore posted by the owner (or a person outside the
guard) as **one comment on the milestone's epic issue**, whose first line is `# Launch #<milestone> <title>`. Retrieval
is read-only and uses the app-configured named human owner: `gate.json`'s `owner` when configured, otherwise the human
personal repository owner's login. It is never automatic execution from a comment's origin, account association or
shared account alone. An advisor may prepare or quote the hand-over text, but that text is advice, not authorization:
a hand-over taken from a collaborator's or shared account, or carrying an advisor's signature, does not count as the
owner's approval. Before handing it to the coordinator, the launcher records the human owner's explicit approval of
the scope and team in the issue thread; only that recorded approval permits execution. The retrieval filter below only
selects comments by the named owner's login for review; it does not authorize execution:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<epic>/comments --paginate --jq \
  '[.[] | select(.body | startswith("# Launch #")) | select(.user.login == "<named-owner>")] | last | .body' \
  > <coordinator clone>/.bive/state/launch.md
# review the retrieved hand-over and confirm the recorded owner approval of scope/team before running:
(cd <coordinator clone> && opencode run --agent coordinator --model <model> "$(cat .bive/state/launch.md)")
```

A hand-over whose `Read:` field is empty is still returned to the owner (`COORDINATOR.md`). A second hand-over
comment replaces the first: the newest wins, and the history stays on the issue.

## Start a delegate (step 5)

```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/issue-<n> -b issue/<n>-<slug> origin/<base>
git config extensions.worktreeConfig true                     # once per clone
git -C .worktrees/issue-<n> config --worktree user.name "delegate <model>"
git -C .worktrees/issue-<n> config --worktree user.email delegate@bive.invalid
mkdir -p .worktrees/issue-<n>/.bive/state
echo delegate > .worktrees/issue-<n>/.bive/state/role          # the guard's sign
# the brief: .bive/templates/brief.md filled into .bive/state/briefs/<n>.md
gh issue comment <n> --body "Started: branch issue/<n>-<slug>, delegate <model>"
brief="$(cat .bive/state/briefs/<n>.md)"                        # read here: outside the delegate's worktree
(cd .worktrees/issue-<n> && BIVE_ROLE=delegate opencode run --agent delegate --model <model> "$brief") &
echo $!                                                         # record the PID (AGENTS.md › Never)
```

On a model fallback (a provider limit, #110 remark 1) restart the brief with the next model and set the identity again,
in one pass: `git -C .worktrees/issue-<n> config --worktree user.name "delegate <next model>"`, then `opencode run
--model <next model>`; the commits keep the canonical name of the model that wrote them.

The `delegate` agent of `opencode.jsonc` gives the session `.bive/prompts/DELEGATE.md` as its system prompt.
`opencode debug agents` lists the agents OpenCode resolved (OpenCode 2.2.5 has no `opencode agent` subcommand).

A project whose checks need a local environment links it into the worktree (for example
`ln -s "$PWD/.venv" .worktrees/issue-<n>/.venv`).

## Start a delegate as a session (0.2; the process start above stays the fallback)

A delegate can be a session of an OpenCode server instead of a process you started: the owner then sees it in the same
OpenCode, and it needs no `cd`. Everything below was verified on OpenCode 2.2.5 (`ROADMAP.md` › 0.2, part 0), except
where it says it was not. Bive ships no script (HANDOFF › *No machinery*): `lib/delegate-session.ts` and
`lib/delegate-run.ts` are pure helpers that **build** the requests and **plan** the fallback; you send them.

1. **A server, once**: `opencode serve --port <p>` prints a password; the requests use basic auth `opencode:<password>`
   (`authHeader`). Keep it running. **Restart it after any change to a plugin or the guard merges**: a running server
   keeps the old plugin code in memory (seen on 2026-11-12: a delegate was refused a pipe the merged guard allows).
   A running local OpenCode service reached with `opencode api` (no password) works as well as a fresh `opencode serve`.
2. **The worktree, identity and role file**: exactly as *Start a delegate* above (steps 1-6 of that block, not the
   `opencode run` line). Run them **one after another, never in one parallel batch**: create the worktree, then
   `checkWorktree({list: <git worktree list --porcelain>, checkout, issue, branch})`; only when it is ok write the role
   file and the identity, then `checkReady({role, userName, canonical})`; only when it is ok launch. `planSetup` gives
   the one next step and never says `launch` before both checks are ok (`lib/delegate-setup.ts`). On any failure
   `planRecovery({markerCreatedByThisAttempt, sessionActive, dirty})` decides: it clears the marker only when this
   attempt made it, the session is known inactive and nothing is dirty. Never clear an active or pre-existing marker
   to retry.
3. **The model**: `resolveFromFile(<text of .bive/state/models.local.json, or undefined>, <canonical>)` (it calls
   `loadAliases`, then `resolveModel`), which stops on a malformed file instead of falling back to the canonical route
   (#258).
   The alias is what the server is asked for; the canonical name is what the identity and the pull request say.
4. **Create, move, check**: `buildCreateRequest({worktree: <absolute path of .worktrees/issue-<n>>, model: ref,
   parentID: $OPENCODE_SESSION_ID, coordinator: {session: $OPENCODE_SESSION_ID, issue}})` is `POST /api/session` with the
   agent `delegate` (the guard recognises it by its agent, #188); `$OPENCODE_SESSION_ID` is the coordinator's own session
   id, set in its shell. The answer is `{data: {id, ...}}`. A child session lands in its parent's directory, so then send
   `buildMoveRequest({sessionID, worktree})` (`POST /api/session/<id>/move`), then `GET /api/session/<id>` and test it
   with `isInWorktree(answer, worktree)`. **Prompt only when it is true**; otherwise remove the session and stop (#256).
   The session then shows under the coordinator's session (#243).
5. **Prompt it with the brief**: `buildPromptRequest({sessionID, brief})` is `POST /api/session/<id>/prompt` with
   `delivery: "queue"`, which is also how to talk to a busy delegate.
6. **Wait**: `buildWaitRequest(sessionID)` is `POST /api/experimental/session/<id>/wait` (204 when it finishes). It is
   *experimental*; the fallback is to follow `GET /api/event` and stop at an event for which
   `isSessionDone(event, sessionID)` is true (`session.execution.succeeded`; the event shape was read loosely and not
   fully verified).
7. **Read the result**: `readBranch({branch, base, git})` says whether the branch is pushed, lists its commits and
   returns the report when the last commit's body starts `Closes #` or `Part of #`. `base` is the bare base name
   (`bived`); `readBranch` adds `origin/` itself. Then review as in step 7 of the
   prompt.
8. **A model error** (`needsFallback({text, status})`): `planFallback({models, failed, aliases, worktree, issue,
   committed, left})` returns the next model, the identity to set (`git ... config --worktree user.name`, canonical
   name), a new create request in the same worktree and a short resume message to send as the prompt. The work already
   committed stays; the next commit names the next model (`docs/PROVIDERS.md` › *Switching mid-work*).
9. **A guard refusal** is a hard stop here too: read the session's last messages, record the refusal on the issue
   (*Refusal and resume*), and resume it with one prompt.

Not verified live end to end yet: the whole path with a real delegate is the pilot (issue #192).

## Wait for process delegates (issue #226)

When a delegate is the process started in *Start a delegate* above (the `opencode run ... &` line), the coordinator
waits for it instead of treating the ended assistant turn as a wait (seen twice on 2026-11-13: the turn ended while
delegates were still running, and each needed another wake-up and a full context reread):

- **Record each delegate's PID at launch**: append `echo $!` to a list (`... & echo $! >> .bive/state/pids.txt`), one
  line per delegate, next to its issue and session id.
- **Wait in the SAME tool invocation as the launch, with a finite overall deadline**, and never end the assistant
  turn while a delegate still runs. Collect every exit code and every report afterwards.
- A delegate launched as a child of that same shell can be waited with `wait <pid>`, which returns its exit code. A
  PID started in another shell cannot be waited (`wait` is not portable there): the supported bounded alternative is
  a loop of `kill -0 <pid>` every few seconds until the deadline. The PID-reuse limitation applies: an old PID can be
  recycled and then make `kill -0` succeed for a long-finished delegate, so a PID alone never decides — the deadline
  and the delegate's own report do.
- **No watcher, no helper package, no pattern kill (`pkill -f`, `killall`), no detached unbounded poller**: only the
  recorded PIDs are ever targeted, and the loop lives inside the waiting tool call.
- **Success**: read the report and review the branch as in *Open and review a pull request* below.
- **Delegate failure** (a non-zero exit or a failed report): record it on the issue, apply *Refusal and resume* /
  gate 2 (issue #192), and resume or split — never take the work over.
- **Timeout at the deadline**: preserve the work as it is, record the still-running PIDs and their session ids, do
  not restart and do not kill the delegates, and ask the owner.

```bash
# wait-recipe (issue #226): bounded same-turn wait for delegates started as processes.
# Set before running: PIDS (space-separated, recorded at launch with `<delegate> & echo $! >> "$LIST"`),
# DEADLINE (overall wait budget, seconds) and POLL (seconds between checks).
# Stay in the SAME tool invocation for the whole block; never end the assistant turn while a delegate runs.
# `wait <pid>` works only on a child of this shell and returns its exit code; a PID started in another
# shell cannot be waited (wait is not portable there), so the supported bounded alternative is a loop of
# `kill -0 <pid>` every POLL seconds until the deadline. PID-reuse limitation: a recycled PID can make
# `kill -0` succeed for a long-finished delegate, so the PID alone never decides: the deadline and the
# delegate's own report do. No watcher, no helper package, no pattern kill (pkill -f / killall), no
# detached unbounded poller: only the recorded PIDs are targeted, and only with the harmless signal 0.
# Optional LAUNCH holds simple commands started here as children of this shell, so `wait` can
# collect their exit codes.

if [ -n "$timed_out" ]; then
  echo "still running at the deadline:$timed_out (ask the owner; do not restart or kill the delegates)"
  exit 124
fi
```

## Open and review a pull request (step 7)

The delegate pushes its branch and returns the filled report; it never opens a pull request. The coordinator creates
the PR from the pushed branch and uses the report as the PR body. For a multi-part issue, open/update it according to
the brief's timing. If the delegate's final response is not accessible from the coordinator's machine, recover the
report from the final pushed commit body (do not expect the delegate's ignored `.bive/state/` file to travel):

```bash
git fetch origin issue/<n>-<slug>
git show -s --format=%H FETCH_HEAD
git log -1 --format=%b FETCH_HEAD
```

The report's Log section should name the commit SHA; the coordinator fills it in if the report was carried in that
commit body. Save the report on the coordinator's machine in `.bive/state/briefs/<n>-report.md`, then run:

```bash
gh pr create --base <base> --head issue/<n>-<slug> --title "#<n>: <title>" --body-file .bive/state/briefs/<n>-report.md
```

The report body starts with `Closes #<n>` when complete, or `Part of #<n>` and what remains.

```bash
gh pr view <pr> --json body,baseRefName,files,commits \
  --jq '.body, .baseRefName, (.files[].path), (.commits[].authors[] | "\(.name) <\(.email)>")'
```

Read it against the checklist: first line `Closes #N` / `Part of #N`; the sections State, Changed, Checks, Left, Log
filled and no `<!--` left; the base; no path matching the inviolable list (`AGENTS.md` › Inviolable prompts, the same
list as `bive-inviolable`); every author `delegate <provider/model> <delegate@bive.invalid>`. Then the brief's checks
in the worktree if the head changed since the report, and the diff. Then wait for CI and hand over:

```bash
gh pr checks <pr> --watch                      # returns when the checks finish; every one but bive-merge-gate green
gh pr review <pr> --approve --body "Ready to merge: <the checks you ran>"
```

The owner merges (`gh pr merge <pr> --merge --match-head-commit <sha>`, after the label); its queue is
`gh pr list --base <base> --search "review:approved"`. By default the coordinator never merges, closes or pushes
to `<base>`; the only possible exception is the explicitly scoped owner grant described in *Coordinator merge
exception (opt-in, off by default)*; no grant exists today. To be woken when it is merged or closed: *Be woken when a pull request is merged* below; otherwise the next
session reads `gh pr list`.
Once merged, if the issue is still open (GitHub closes on the default branch only), close it only after
checking that the pull request's merge commit is reachable from the base:

```bash
merge_commit="$(gh pr view <pr> --json mergeCommit --jq .mergeCommit.oid)"
git fetch origin <base>
if git merge-base --is-ancestor "$merge_commit" "origin/<base>"; then
  gh issue close <n> --comment "Done in <base> at $merge_commit (PR #<pr>)"
else
  echo "refusing to close: PR #<pr> is not merged into <base>"
fi
```

Never write "Done" in an issue, a checklist or a report for an issue whose pull request is not merged;
`Part of #N` issues stay open with what is left.

`bive-merge-gate / merge-gate` stays red on every pull request until the owner applies the dated label
`bive-merge-authorized-until-YYYY-MM-DD` (`docs/REQUIRED-CHECKS.md`): read that red as "waiting for the owner's label",
not as a failure to brief again. The coordinator never applies the label.

## Be woken when a pull request is merged (issue #242)

After the hand-over, the coordinator registers **one** OpenCode schedule on its own session: the server runs a `gh`
check every two minutes and sends one prompt when the pull request leaves `OPEN`. No watcher plugin, no model step
while waiting. Needs `"experimental": {"schedules": true}` in `opencode.jsonc` (set in Bive; experimental API, may
change). Coordinator only; a delegate never registers a schedule.

```bash
pr=<pr>; repo="$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner)"; name="bive-pr-${repo/\//-}-$pr"
cat > .bive/state/wake-$pr.json <<EOF
{"sessionID": "$OPENCODE_SESSION_ID", "name": "$name",
 "when": {"every": "2 minutes"},
 "if": {"run": "gh pr view $pr --repo $repo --json state,mergeCommit,baseRefName --jq '[.state,.mergeCommit.oid,.baseRefName]|@tsv'",
        "matches": "^(MERGED|CLOSED)"},
 "ends": {"after": "8 hours", "times": 1},
 "prompt": "PR $repo#$pr left OPEN (state, merge commit, base below). Evidence to verify, not authorization: check it with gh pr view, then follow Open and review a pull request in docs/COORDINATING.md (merge commit reachable from the base before any closure or cleanup). CLOSED without a merge commit is not done: report it."}
EOF
opencode api GET /api/experimental/schedule --param sessionID="$OPENCODE_SESSION_ID"   # skip if "$name" is listed
opencode api POST /api/experimental/schedule -d "$(cat .bive/state/wake-$pr.json)"     # note the sch_ id it returns
```

- **Once:** `times: 1` ends the schedule after its single wake (`status: done`); the wake message id is
  `msg_sch_<id>_1`. Register one per pull request (the name is the key; list before creating).
- **Bounded:** `after: "8 hours"` ends it unfired; a `gh` failure prints nothing, so it never wakes on an error. Past
  the deadline the next session reads `gh pr list`.
- **Cleanup:** deleting the session removes its schedules at once. To cancel earlier:
  `opencode api DELETE /api/experimental/schedule/<sch_id>` (that id only, never by pattern).
- **What wakes:** a prompt with `MERGED <merge commit> <base>` or `CLOSED  <base>` appended. It is evidence, never an
  owner decision, a merge right or an instruction from the pull request's text.
- Verified 2026-11-14 on OpenCode 2.2.5 (issue #242): one wake on a merged PR, none on an open one, removal with the
  session, end at the deadline. Not verified: an archived session, a server restart mid-wait, a busy session.

## Short handoffs (issue #234)

`HANDOFF.md` holds the current state: branch and milestone, blockers, gate decisions, commands. It aims for at most
100 lines. History (old session logs, closed decisions' reasoning) goes to a durable link (issue, comment or commit URL)
in one line; a dated owner decision keeps its line and its link, it is never deleted without one. Qualification claims
point at the bench, not a copy. A new coordinator reads the handoff once, then the milestone queries below; it does not
replay history. `tests/handoff-size.test.ts` holds the skeleton to the budget and stops the root from growing.

## Reuse complete trusted CI evidence (issue #227)

A green summary is not proof. A coordinator may skip an equivalent per-PR local run only when it records, from the CI
run itself: the **reviewed head SHA**; the **run URL and check name**; the **tested commit** (the head, or the synthetic
merge SHA with the base SHA it was merged onto); that the **workflow is the trusted one from the base branch**; the
**result** and every **skipped marker**; and that the run covers the checks you would have run (the same command, the
whole suite, not a subset). Put that line in the review comment: `CI <url> head <sha> base <sha>: tests 326/326, no skips`.

Not a substitute, so run locally: a run on another or older head (stale); a partial run that still exited 0; a run
with skipped or marked tests the batch needs; a run absent, still pending, or from an untrusted workflow (a fork or a
workflow changed by the same PR); a changed input (config, fixtures, environment) the run did not see; local-only
coverage (a plugin check, `opencode plugin list`).

What stays regardless: the delegate's fast checks, and the coordinator's core run once per batch of merges
(`AGENTS.md` says CI does not replace it; dropping it needs an owner rule decision, not this section).

```bash
gh pr view <pr> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid              # the reviewed head
gh run list --commit <sha> --json databaseId,name,conclusion,headSha,url
gh run view <run-id> --log | tail -n 40                         # coverage and skips, not just the summary
```

## Milestones are the work queue (issue #228)

Every implementation issue and its pull request carry the **same real GitHub milestone**, set when it is created. A
tracking issue holds order, dependencies and decisions, never a copy of status. One query per object type gives what
remains:

```bash
gh issue list --milestone "<title>" --state open --json number,title,labels
gh pr list --state open --search 'milestone:"<title>"' --json number,title,baseRefName
```

Creation and review checklist: the issue has the milestone; the PR has the milestone of the issue it closes; a `Part of`
issue stays open and listed until its last part merges. Reconcile bounded: list issues and PRs without a milestone
(`gh issue list --search "no:milestone"`), attach, do not move old issues or touch other milestones' PRs. A
cross-cutting issue gets the milestone it blocks and a comment naming the exception. No new task service.

## Refusal and resume (issues #146, #147)

When a delegate reports a refusal (guard, scanner, or any check):

1. Record the refusal: the refused command, the refusal message, and the worktree state.
2. Preserve all uncommitted work in the worktree — do not discard or push it.
3. Do not let the delegate continue or push. A refusal is a hard stop, not a prompt to rewrite the command.
4. Before any subsequent delegate starts, require a clear owner decision on how to proceed: resume the same
   delegate with a corrected brief, split the work, or stop.
5. Do not normalize retries as a workaround.

**Recording the authorization (issue #147):** before resuming after a refusal, post a comment on the issue recording
the refusal (command, message, worktree state) and the owner's explicit authorization to resume (or the
decision to split or stop). The coordinator does not resume on its own authority; the owner's decision must be
visible in the issue's comment thread before any delegate starts. If the owner's decision is not recorded, the
refusal stands and no subsequent delegate starts.

The delegate's prompt (`DELEGATE.md`) carries the matching rule: on refusal, stop immediately, do not retry by
rewriting the command, do not continue with other commands, do not push, preserve uncommitted work, and report the
refusal with the exact command, message, and worktree state.

## Your own refusals (issue #201)

The coordinator is also guarded. Same rule as a delegate's: do not rerun the effect another way before reporting. Post
a comment on the issue with the command and the refusal message, and say what you were doing; only then continue.

A refusal about the command's **shape** (`invalid-structure`) may be rephrased, in the same comment, into one of
these forms, all seen on 2026-11-12:

| Refused | Why | Use instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a redirect to a parent-directory path after a `cd` | redirects are resolved against the session root, not the directory after the `cd` | run from the root; give absolute paths inside the worktree |
| `$(...)` in a call whose workdir is a delegate's worktree | any call there is checked as that delegate's | run from the root with `cd .worktrees/issue-<n> && ...` |
| a `gh ... --body "..."` whose text has a parent-directory path | the quoted text is scanned | write the text to a file with the write tool, pass `--body-file` |

A refusal about **where** (a path outside the worktree, an inviolable file, an external directory) is a boundary, not
a shape: stop and ask through the chain (skill `bive-ask-owner`). Never reach the same path or file another way.

## After the batch (step 9)

The core checks once, after the last merge, then `HANDOFF.md` and `ROADMAP.md` in one commit on a coordinator branch,
opened as a pull request labelled `coordinator` and merged by the owner like any other. Clean up:
`git worktree list`, then `git worktree remove .worktrees/issue-<n>` and `git branch -d issue/<n>-<slug>` for each
merged issue (never forced).

## Branches and inherited commits (issue #73)

Each issue branch starts from the current integration base (`origin/<base>` after `git fetch --prune`), never from
another issue branch: a branch created from a sibling inherits its commits and merge commits, and the later pull
request then carries them. Dependent work waits for the previous merge.

Before opening a pull request, check that the branch is clean of inherited work:

```bash
git fetch origin <base>
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/<base> HEAD          # must succeed
git rev-list --merges origin/<base>..HEAD                # must be empty
```

If either fails, create a fresh branch from `origin/<base>` and cherry-pick only the issue's own commits (never
rewrite pushed history):

```bash
git switch -c issue/<n>-<slug>-fresh origin/<base>
git cherry-pick <issue-commit>...
```

## Two coordinators at once

The owner may start one coordinator per milestone, at most as many as the runners able to take the fast checks (and
never more than two) (`AGENTS.md` › Roles). Each coordinator keeps at most one CI run in flight (a new push waits for
the previous run). Each works in its own clone, because `.worktrees/`, `.bive/state/` and the guard belong to one
checkout:

```bash
git clone <repository> <dir> && cd <dir> && git switch milestone/<name>
gh pr list --base milestone/<name>                    # the pull requests this coordinator reviews, and no others
gh pr list --label coordinator --state open           # before opening a coordinator PR on an inviolable file: empty
```

At gate 1 each milestone lists the files it will touch; where the two lists overlap, the owner names one writer
or the order, and the brief says so. Each coordinator writes only its milestone's section of `HANDOFF.md` and
`ROADMAP.md`.

## GitHub pull-request merge methods

The repository allows `merge` only (`AGENTS.md` › Project rules): a merge commit keeps every delegate's commit under
its author; squash would attribute the result to the account that pressed the button. The owner keeps **Settings →
General → Pull Requests** aligned.

## Scripting it

A project may script this routine in its own repository (start, review, status, clean): one Python / ImGui project
did, in about 400 lines with tests, and used it for a whole batch. Bive ships no such script (HANDOFF › Decisions,
*No machinery*): the prompt and this page are enough for any coordinator, and a script stays the project's own,
outside Bive's files.
